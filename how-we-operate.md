## How we operate

### Communication

With a distributed team keeping communication clear and inclusive is a top priority. That's why we focus on asyncronous communication channels that keep everybody in the loop and allow everybody to provide insights and feedback.

We use the following tools to accomplish this:

1. **Slack** - for day to day conversation, checking in, memes, sending out kudos for a job well done, informal announcents, etc.
2. **Email** - used for formal communications or long form messages that include a lot of details. Use email when you don't want anything to fall through the cracks or get lost in chatter.
3. **Github** - everything important lives in Github. This includes company policies, processes, products, OKRs etc. Every team member has the ability to issue a pull request to make an edit or a change.
4. **Asana** - task management tool that we use to outline projects and assign tasks to ourselves and each other.

### Standing meetings

We try to keep meetings to a minimum, but in order to keep everybody on the same page and rowing in the same direction we have a few standing meetings on the calendar. When you are added the the team Casey and your team lead will make sure that you receive invitations to all required meetings.

- **Weekly all hands meeting**: Who attends: Everybody (contractors optional). Each team member has a slide in the deck they can update with photos, stories, memes to share in the weekly meeting. This is our chance to get everybody together, spread a little empathy, and align on the week's goals.
- **Daily stand up meetings**: Who attends: Product team. These daily stand ups are for the product team to check in each day.
- **Weekly growth meetings**: Who attends: Growth team. Weekly meeting to assess company growth trends, plan new campaigns, and assess progress on OKRs.

### What products we use

When in doubt always err on the side of cloud scaleability. 

- **Google Docs** - Best when working on documents that need to be edited by multiple people and don't fit well in Github.
- **Slides.com** - For building presentations
- **1Password** - Each team member is added to the Serverless 1PW account and any applicable vaults. Use 1PW to generate complex passwords and keep them stored without having to write them down.
- **Expensify** - For reimbursing employee expenses.
- **Bill.com** - For paying vendors and US based contractors.

### Company policies

- **Expenses**: Spend company money like it was your own. We're a small start trying to preserve our capital as best as possible while we launch our next product. If you do need to get reimbursed submit your receipts on Expensity and make sure to put a detailed note as to what the expense was for so that Casey can approve it faster.
- **Travel**: When planning a company trip make sure it's approved by your manager. Book flights in economony class and use Uber Pool or Lyft Line when possible for individual ground transportation.
- **Time off**: When we say unlimited paid time off, we actually mean it. That's why we require that each team member take a minium of 20 days off a year to ensure that they have time to recharge and keep the creativity flowing. Before making any travel arrangements get your time off approved by your direct manager. Make sure to give them ample notice to allow for coverage while you're out. Once your time off is approved, schedule your time out on the team PTO calendar and send an email the the team email account so that everybody knows the dates you'll be gone. This also applies if you are planning on working remotely for more than a day. Check in with your manager to make sure you're not needed to be in client meetings or company trainings.
- **Nondiscrimination policy**: Serverless is an equal opportunity employer. We will not discriminate and will take affirmative action measures to ensure against discrimination in employment, recruitment, advertisements for employment, compensation, termination, upgrading, promotions, and other conditions of employment against any employee or job applicant on the bases of race, color, gender, national origin, age, religion, creed, disability, veteran's status, sexual orientation, gender identity or gender expression.
